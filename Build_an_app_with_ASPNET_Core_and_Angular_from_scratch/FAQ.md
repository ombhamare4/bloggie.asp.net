## Q. What is solution file in .Net.

In .NET, a solution file (with a .sln extension) is a file generated by Visual Studio to manage one or more projects. It's essentially a container for multiple projects that belong to the same solution.

A solution file contains references to all the projects within the solution, as well as configuration information such as build order, project dependencies, and solution-level settings.

Having a solution file makes it easier to manage and work with multiple related projects within Visual Studio. It allows you to build, debug, and manage projects as a single unit.
